Hints:
1. Windows firewall may block the server by default, if it happens, run **SetupWindowsFirewall.bat** to set an access rule.

# Key Features
- Painless setup: Just run the server binary on your PC, scan QR code on your phone and send files/text messages, no need to install Apps on your phone.
- Cross-platform: Server runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. 
- Privacy preserving: A one-time password and QR code is generated for each run of the server. All the data is stored in the RAM of the server temporarily and won't be saved to the disk.
- Easy to use: You can share files/images by simply dragging and dropping them.
